# azureADDivGroups

Reconciles the membership of the Azure groups in Active Directory
This is to manage a list of all divisions within Northeastern.  The script requires the DIV groups to be created externally by AD admins.  Will throw an error if a new Division becomes available but there isn't a corresponding AD group.
